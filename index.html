    <h2><strong>About Me</strong></h2>
      <h5><em>Background</em></h5>
        <p>Born and raised in Kirkland Washington i grew up with 3 brothers. I attended
        Lake Washington High School on the eastside and played a ton of basketball all over the greater
        Seattle area. I was able to recieve a basketball scholarship to Simon Fraser University in
        Vancouver, BC where i studied business management. After graduating i moved to Arizona to work for
        a large investment management company for a year before i discovered a love for coding and design, Which brought
        me back to Seattle and to Epicodus! </p>
      <h5><em>Interests</em></h5>
        <p>Beyond my love for basketball and other sports, i have always been an avid hiker. I love to get outside as
        much as possible and explore new areas. Another passion that i have been fortunate enough to take advantage of
        is travel. Seeing new places, cultures and experiences is something i try to do as often as i can. After spending several months
        backpacking around Europe last summer i cant wait for my next adventure and hope to get out to SE Asia next. Other
        hobbies include binge-watching netflix series, food, and video games.</p>
